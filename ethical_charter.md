## Awesome Prompt Engineering Ethical Charter
It is important to consider ethics when contributing to the development of AI, whether it is through an open-source project 
like the ***Awesome Prompt Engineering***  or through developing your own project, 
because AI has the potential to significantly impact society in both positive and negative ways. 
AI systems can be used to improve healthcare, education, transportation, and other areas of life, 
but they can also be used to violate privacy, perpetuate bias, and harm individuals or society as a whole. 
Therefore, it is crucial that AI developers and researchers are guided by ethical principles and responsible 
practices that prioritize the well-being of humans and society. This will not only help to prevent negative consequences 
but also promote trust, credibility, and acceptance of AI technology by stakeholders.

## Awesome Prompt Engineering Community Values
The Awesome Prompt Engineering Community Values were created to provide a framework for ethical behavior and responsible practices in the 
development and deployment of AI technology. As AI continues to have an increasingly significant impact on society, 
it is important that developers and researchers are committed to promoting the well-being and flourishing of individuals and society as a whole. 
The values outlined in the charter promote human-centeredness, fairness, transparency, privacy, safety, and accountability, 
and are intended to guide the behavior of community members in a way that is consistent with these principles. 
By upholding these values, the Awesome Prompt Engineering Community seeks to build trust and credibility with stakeholders 
and promote the responsible development and use of AI technology.
