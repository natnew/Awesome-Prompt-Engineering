# Documentation Instructions

## Core Principles

- **Accuracy**: Content must be technically accurate and verified.
- **Clarity**: Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon unless necessary and defined.
- **Conciseness**: Get to the point. Avoid fluff and conversational filler.
- **Consistency**: Follow the established structure and formatting.

## Documentation Structure (Diátaxis)

We follow the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) which identifies four distinct documentation needs:

1.  **Tutorials** (Learning-oriented): Lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project.
2.  **How-to Guides** (Problem-oriented): Guides that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.
3.  **Reference** (Information-oriented): Technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.
4.  **Explanation** (Understanding-oriented): Discussions that clarify and illuminate a particular topic.

## Formatting Guidelines

- **Headings**: Use sentence case for headings (e.g., "Create a new project" not "Create a New Project").
- **Links**: Use descriptive link text. Avoid "click here".
- **Code Blocks**: Always specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., \`\`\`python).
- **Lists**: Use unordered lists for items where order doesn't matter, and ordered lists for steps.
- **Bold**: Use bold for UI elements and key terms when first introduced.

## Tone and Voice

- **Professional & Friendly**: Helpful but not overly casual.
- **Objective**: Avoid marketing language ("easy", "simple", "powerful").
- **Active Voice**: "Run the command" rather than "The command should be run".
