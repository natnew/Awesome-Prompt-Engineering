# Foundations

The theory behind effective AI systems. Mental models that inform practice.

---

## Why Foundations Matter

You can use AI effectively without understanding how it works—until you can't. When prompts fail mysteriously, when outputs degrade unexpectedly, when costs explode—that's when mental models pay off.

Foundations aren't about becoming an ML researcher. They're about building intuition that helps you:

- **Debug** — Understand why something isn't working
- **Design** — Make informed architectural choices
- **Predict** — Anticipate how changes will affect behavior
- **Communicate** — Explain decisions to stakeholders

| Topic | What You'll Learn | Time |
|:------|:------------------|:-----|
| [How LLMs Work](how_llms_work.md) | Mental models for language models (no ML background required) | 20 min |
| [Tokens and Context](tokens_and_context.md) | The currency of LLM interaction | 15 min |

### Evaluation & Quality

| Topic | What You'll Learn | Time |
|:------|:------------------|:-----|

| [The Measurement Problem](measurement_problem.md) | Why AI evaluation is hard, and what to do about it | 15 min |

### Safety & Reliability

## How to Use Foundations

### If You're New to AI

Read in order:
1. How LLMs Work
2. Tokens and Context
3. Prompt Engineering Principles
4. Then explore based on interest

### If You're Experienced

Use as reference. Jump to specific topics when you need deeper understanding of a concept encountered in projects.

### For Teams

Foundations provide shared vocabulary. When everyone understands "context window" or "temperature" the same way, collaboration improves.

## Foundations vs. Projects vs. Patterns

| Content Type | Purpose | Format |
|:-------------|:--------|:-------|
| **Foundations** | Build mental models | Explanatory content |
| **Projects** | Build skills through practice | Guided exercises |
| **Patterns** | Apply proven solutions | Reference material |

Foundations inform projects. Projects apply patterns. Patterns encode lessons from projects.

## A Note on Depth

These foundations are deliberately practical. They prioritize useful mental models over technical completeness.

For deeper technical understanding:
- [Anthropic's Research](https://www.anthropic.com/research)
- [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
- [Andrej Karpathy's Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)

But you don't need that depth to use AI effectively. Start here.
