## What It Does

_[2-3 sentences in plain language. No jargon. What problem does it solve?]_

**Example:**
> This system helps customer support agents respond faster by suggesting relevant answers from our knowledge base. Agents review suggestions before sending — the AI drafts, humans decide.

---

## What It Doesn't Do

Be explicit about limitations. Managing expectations prevents disappointment.

| It Does NOT... | Why This Matters |
|:---------------|:-----------------|
| _[Limitation 1]_ | _[Business implication]_ |
| _[Limitation 2]_ | _[Business implication]_ |
| _[Limitation 3]_ | _[Business implication]_ |

**Example:**
| It Does NOT... | Why This Matters |
|:---------------|:-----------------|
| Make final decisions | Human approval required for all responses |
| Access real-time data | Can't answer questions about orders placed today |
| Handle multiple languages | Only supports English currently |

---

## How It Works (Simplified)

_[Non-technical explanation. Use analogies.]_

**Example:**
> Think of it like a very fast research assistant. When an agent gets a question, the system searches our entire knowledge base in seconds, finds the most relevant articles, and drafts a response based on them. The agent then edits, approves, or discards the suggestion.

**Key point for stakeholders:**  
_[The one thing you want them to remember]_

|:-------|:--------|:-------|:--------------|

| Time to first response | -40% | -50% | Agents respond significantly faster |
