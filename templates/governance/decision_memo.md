# Decision Memo: [Feature/Project Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Author:** [Your name]  
**Status:** Draft | Under Review | Final  
**Decision Requested By:** YYYY-MM-DD

---

## Recommendation

**[ ] BUILD** — Proceed with development  
**[ ] PILOT** — Test with limited scope first  
**[ ] DEFER** — Revisit under specified conditions  
**[ ] REJECT** — Do not proceed  

**One-sentence rationale:**  
_[Why this recommendation, in plain language]_

## Summary

| Metric | Value | Confidence |
|:-------|:------|:-----------|
| Development Cost | $_____ | High/Medium/Low |
| Annual Operating Cost | $_____ | High/Medium/Low |
| Expected Annual Benefit | $_____ | High/Medium/Low |
| Payback Period | ___ months | |
| Year 1 ROI | ___% | |

## The Proposal

**What:** _[One sentence describing what we're deciding]_

**Why now:** _[What triggered this decision]_

**Alternatives considered:**
1. _[Alternative 1]_ — Rejected because: ___
2. _[Alternative 2]_ — Rejected because: ___
3. Do nothing — Consequence: ___

## Benefits

| Benefit | Annual Value | Confidence | Basis |
|:--------|:-------------|:-----------|:------|
| _[Primary benefit]_ | $_____ | High/Med/Low | _[How calculated]_ |
| _[Secondary benefit]_ | $_____ | High/Med/Low | _[How calculated]_ |
| _[Tertiary benefit]_ | $_____ | High/Med/Low | _[How calculated]_ |

**What's NOT quantified:**  
_[Qualitative benefits we believe exist but can't measure]_

## Costs

### One-Time (Development)

| Category | Estimate | Notes |
|:---------|:---------|:------|
| Engineering | $_____ | _[X people × Y weeks × rate]_ |
| Design | $_____ | |
| Other | $_____ | |
| **Total** | **$_____** | |

### Ongoing (Monthly)

| Category | Estimate | Notes |
|:---------|:---------|:------|
| Infrastructure | $_____ | _[API calls, compute, storage]_ |
| Maintenance | $_____ | _[Hours/month × rate]_ |
| Other | $_____ | |
| **Total** | **$_____/month** | |

### Hidden Costs (Often Missed)

- [ ] Opportunity cost: What else could the team build?
- [ ] Training: Learning curve for users/operators
- [ ] Support: New question types, escalations
- [ ] Risk mitigation: Safety work, legal review

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|:-----|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|
| _[Technical risk]_ | H/M/L | H/M/L | _[How we'll address]_ |
| _[Business risk]_ | H/M/L | H/M/L | _[How we'll address]_ |
| _[Safety risk]_ | H/M/L | H/M/L | _[How we'll address]_ |

**Worst realistic case:**  
_[If this goes badly, what happens? Is that acceptable?]_

## Success Criteria

If we proceed, we will measure success by:

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Review Date |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------------|:------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Kill criteria:** We will stop/roll back if:
- _[Condition 1]_
- _[Condition 2]_
