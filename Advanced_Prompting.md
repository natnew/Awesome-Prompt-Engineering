## Advanced Prompting
Advanced prompting techniques are essential for building state-of-the-art AI models that can perform complex tasks requiring reasoning and decision-making. 
Two popular methods of advanced prompting are ReAct and HotpotQA. ReAct is a technique that combines reasoning and acting in language models, 
allowing them to reason about the context and take action accordingly. This approach has been shown to improve the accuracy of models in tasks such as 
question-answering and language inference. HotpotQA, on the other hand, is a dataset designed for multi-hop question-answering, which requires models to 
answer questions that require information from multiple sources. This dataset has been widely used to evaluate the performance of AI models in complex reasoning tasks, 
and models trained on it have achieved state-of-the-art results. By leveraging these advanced prompting techniques, AI engineers can build models that can reason 
and make decisions like humans, enabling them to tackle complex real-world problems.

##### The ChatGPT Formula 
You are a ```{actor}```. You are performing ```{task}```. ```{system boundary}```
