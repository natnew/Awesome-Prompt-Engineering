## What You've Learned

Over this project, you've covered:

1. **Incident Framework** — Lifecycle, severity, roles
2. **Detection** — Monitoring, alerting, anomaly detection
3. **Response** — Mitigation, investigation, decision-making
4. **Communication** — Who, what, when to communicate
5. **Recovery** — Safe restoration, verification
6. **Learning** — Post-mortems, blameless culture

## Reflection Questions

1. **What's the most likely AI incident your system will face?**

2. **How quickly would you detect it? How confident are you?**

3. **Who has authority to disable your AI system in an emergency?**

4. **What's your biggest incident response gap right now?**

5. **After completing this project, what's your first action item?**

## What You've Learned

### Technical Skills
- [ ] Design detection and alerting for AI systems
- [ ] Respond to AI-specific incident types
- [ ] Conduct blameless post-mortems
- [ ] Write effective runbooks

### Professional Skills
- [ ] Communicate effectively during incidents
- [ ] Make mitigation decisions under pressure
- [ ] Lead incident response efforts
- [ ] Generate actionable improvements

### Mental Models
- [ ] "Mitigate first, investigate later"
- [ ] "Communicate early and often"
- [ ] "Blameless doesn't mean unaccountable"
- [ ] "Every incident is a learning opportunity"

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Completed at least one scenario walkthrough
- [ ] Created incident runbook for your system
- [ ] Prepared communication templates
- [ ] Completed a practice post-mortem
- [ ] Identified top gaps in incident readiness
- [ ] Created action items to address gaps

---

## Completion

Congratulations on completing the Incident Response Simulation.

Incidents will happen. The question is whether you're prepared.

You now have:
- A framework for thinking about incidents
- Practice handling AI-specific scenarios
- Templates and runbooks ready to use
- Knowledge of how to learn from failures

The best time to prepare for an incident is before it happens. That time is now.
