# Synthesis

Reflect on what you've built, document your decisions, and prepare your portfolio artifact.

## Reflection Prompts

### On Event-Driven Design

1. **What makes event processing different from batch processing?**
   - What design decisions changed because of streaming?
   - How did latency requirements shape your design?
   - Where did you trade accuracy for speed?

2. **How did you balance sensitivity and specificity?**
   - What's the cost of a false negative?
   - What's the cost of a false positive?
   - How do your thresholds reflect these costs?

3. **How does your system handle the unknown?**
   - What happens with truly novel events?
   - How do you avoid over-fitting to known patterns?
   - How do you surface genuine discoveries?

### On Multi-Agent Architecture

1. **Why this agent decomposition?**
   - What alternatives did you consider?
   - How do you balance speed and depth?
   - What happens if an agent fails?

2. **How do agents coordinate under time pressure?**
   - How do you meet latency targets?
   - What shortcuts are acceptable?
   - When do you skip agents entirely?

3. **What would you add with unlimited resources?**
   - What agents are missing?
   - What would improve detection?
   - What's the 80/20 of value?

### On Provenance

1. **What makes provenance essential here?**
   - Why can't scientists trust without verification?
   - What does publishable provenance require?
   - How do you balance completeness and overhead?

2. **How do you ensure reproducibility?**
   - Can someone reproduce your detection?
   - What might break reproducibility?
   - How do you verify reproducibility?

3. **How does provenance support operations?**
   - How do operators debug issues?
   - How do scientists verify claims?
   - How do you support audits?

### On the Process

1. **What surprised you building this?**
   - What was harder than expected?
   - What was easier?
   - What would you do differently?

2. **How does this connect to other domains?**
   - Where else does event processing apply?
   - What patterns transfer?
   - What's specific to science?

3. **What did you learn about discovery infrastructure?**
   - What makes good infrastructure invisible?
   - How do you measure success?
   - What's the relationship between infrastructure and discovery?
