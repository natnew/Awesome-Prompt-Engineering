# Synthesis

Reflect on what you've built, document your decisions, and prepare your portfolio artifact.

---

## What You've Built

Over this project, you've designed:

| Component | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| **Knowledge architecture** | How to represent and retrieve scientific knowledge |
| **Multi-agent system** | Specialised agents for different scientific domains |

## Reflection Prompts

### On Scientific Standards

1. **What makes scientific AI different from general AI?**
   - What requirements did science impose?
   - How did these shape your design?
   - What would you compromise on? What wouldn't you?

2. **How confident are you in your provenance system?**
   - Where could claims still slip through without proper sourcing?
   - What would full integrity require?
   - How do you balance rigour with practicality?

3. **Where does your system's authority end?**
   - What should scientists still do themselves?
   - How do you communicate those boundaries?
   - What happens when users push against limits?

### On Multi-Agent Design

1. **Why this agent decomposition?**
   - What alternatives did you consider?
   - What's gained by specialisation?
   - What coordination challenges emerge?

2. **How do agents handle disagreement?**
   - What if literature agent and chemistry agent conflict?
   - Who arbitrates?
   - How is this visible to users?

3. **What would you add with more resources?**
   - What agents are missing?
   - What capabilities would improve quality?
   - What's the 80/20 of effort to value?

### On Evaluation

1. **How do you know this system is working?**
   - What gives you confidence?
   - What could fool your metrics?
   - Where are your blind spots?

2. **What failures worry you most?**
   - What's the worst-case scenario?
   - How would you detect it?
   - How would you recover?

3. **How would a scientist actually evaluate this?**
   - What would they check first?
   - What would build trust?
   - What would destroy trust?

### On the Process

1. **What surprised you building this?**
   - What was harder than expected?
   - What was easier?
   - What would you do differently?

2. **What did you learn about AI for science?**
   - Key insights?
   - Changed perspectives?
   - New questions?

3. **How does this connect to your broader work?**
   - Transferable patterns?
   - Reusable components?
   - Future directions?
